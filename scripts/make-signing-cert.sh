# Makes a self-signed code signing certificate for building CardStock on this
# Mac, and writes Config/Local.xcconfig to use it.
#
# Why: ad-hoc builds look like a new app to macOS every time, so it asks
# again for the Keychain ("Always Allow" for the GitHub token) and for folder
# access (Desktop, Documents) after each build. Signing every build with the
# same certificate lets macOS remember. No Apple account is needed; the
# certificate only works on this Mac and isn't used for releases.
#
# Usage: scripts/make-signing-cert.sh   (does nothing if the certificate exists)
